## 0. Abstract

The recent advancements in radiotherapy technologies have made delivery of the highly conformal dose to the target volume possible. With the increasing popularity of delivering high dose per fraction in modern radiotherapy schemes such as in stereotactic body radiotherapy and stereotactic body ablative therapy, high degree of treatment precision is essential. In order to achieve this, we have to overcome the potential difficulties caused by patient instability due to immobilization problems; patient anxiety and random motion due to prolonged treatment time; tumor deformation and baseline shift during a treatment course. This is even challenging for patients receiving radiotherapy in the chest and abdominal regions because it is affected by the patient’s respiration which inevitably leads to tumor motion. Therefore, monitoring of intrafractional motion has become increasingly important in modern radiotherapy. Major intrafractional motion management strategies including integration of respiratory motion in treatment planning; breath-hold technique; forced shallow breathing with abdominal compression; respiratory gating and dynamic real-time tumor tracking have been developed. Successful intrafractional motion management is able to reduce the planning target margin and ensures planned dose delivery to the target and organs at risk. Meanwhile, the emergency of MRI-linear accelerator has facilitated radiation-free real-time monitoring of soft tissue during treatment and could be the future modality in motion management. This review article summarizes the various approaches that deal with intrafractional target, organs or patient motion with discussion of their advantages and limitations. In addition, the potential future advancements including MRI-based tumor tracking are also discussed.

放射治疗技术的最近发展，使得对目标体进行高适形的剂量输送成为可能。在现代放射治疗方案中，随着越来越多的在每次分次中进行高剂量输送，如立体定向体部放射治疗，非常高的治疗精度是关键的。为得到这种效果，我们要克服患者固定问题造成的不稳定导致的困难；由于治疗时间拉长，造成的患者紧张和随机运动；在治疗过程中肿瘤的变形和基准偏移。对于接受胸腹部区域放射治疗的患者，这尤其具有挑战性，因为这受到患者的呼吸影响，不可避免的导致肿瘤的运动。因此，监控分次内治疗中的运动，在现代放射治疗中越来越重要。主要的分次内运动管理策略包括，治疗计划中纳入呼吸运动的影响；屏气技术；采用腹压进行强迫式浅呼吸；呼吸门控和动态实时肿瘤追踪。成功的分次内运动管理，可以减少计划目标的边缘余地，确保计划的剂量输送到目标和OAR。同时，MRI直线加速器的出现，促进了在治疗中对软组织的无辐射实时监控，可能是运动管理的未来模态。本文总结了各种处理分次内目标、器官或患者运动的方法，讨论了其优点和局限。另外，还讨论了未来的发展，包括基于MRI的肿瘤跟踪。

## 1. Background

The goals of radiotherapy treatment are to deliver the sufficient radiation dose to the tumor so as to achieve adequate tumor control and low dose to the organs at risk (OARs) so as to minimize radiation-induced toxicity. With the recent advancements in radiotherapy technologies, external beam radiotherapy has been evolved to the delivery of highly conformal dose to the target volumes. These include intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and stereotactic ablative body radiation therapy (SBAR). In addition, hypofractionation schemes which employs higher dose per fraction and less number of fractions has become more popular and they are used to treat malignant diseases including lung, liver, pancreas, breast and prostate cancers [1–5].

放射治疗的目标是将充足的放射剂量输送到肿瘤，以获得充分的肿瘤控制，并将很低的剂量输送到OAR，以最小化放射带来的副作用。随着最近放射治疗技术的进展，外照射放射治疗已经演化到，将高适形的剂量输送到目标体中。这包括IMRT，VMAT，SBRT和SBAR。另外，大剂量分割的方案在每个分次中输送更高的剂量，需要的分次更少，这正在越来越流行，用于治疗恶性疾病，包括肺部、肝脏、胰腺、乳腺和前列腺肿瘤。

With the characteristics of delivering high dose per fraction, high degree of precision and rapid fall-off of radiation dose around the target volume in SBRT and SBAR, a high accuracy of target dose delivery is needed. Any tumor movement during treatment must be corrected so as to ensure that it receives the intended radiation dose. Dose escalation and tumor control may be limited by target or organs motion during irradiation resulted from various physiological processes. For instance, patients receiving radiotherapy treatment in the chest and abdominal regions are affected by normal breathing condition, and there is inevitable tumor motion due to respiration. In addition, the problems of patient instability due to imperfect immobilization device, patient anxiety and random motion due to prolonged treatment time, tumor deformation and baseline shift, have also been reported [6]. Tracking and monitoring of intrafractional motion has become increasingly important in modern radiotherapy.

由于在SBRT和SBAR中每次进行大剂量输送，精度高，辐射剂量在目标体附近快速跌落，所以需要对目标剂量进行高精度输送。治疗中任何肿瘤运动都必须进行修正，以确保正确的辐射剂量输送。由于在放射过程中多种生理过程会导致目标或器官运动，剂量调整和肿瘤控制可能会受到限制。比如，胸腹部进行放射治疗的患者，会受到正常呼吸运动的影响，在呼吸的时候会不可避免的有肿瘤运动。另外，由于固定设备的不完善，导致的病人不稳定问题，由于治疗时间延长导致的患者紧张和随机运动，肿瘤形变和基准移动，也有报道。跟踪和监控分次内运动，在现代放射治疗中已经变得越来越重要。

The traditional method to avoid geographical miss of a moving target is to give a more generous margin to gross tumor volume (GTV), which enables to ensure the adequate tumor coverage. However, this inevitably leads to the irradiation of a relatively large volume of surrounding healthy tissue. Previous studies shown that tumor or organ motion was the greatest in the cranio-caudal direction, while left-right and antero-posterior amplitude were comparatively smaller [7–9]. Akimoto M et al. [9] reported that tumor motion could be up to 15 to 24 mm in the cranio-caudal direction in pancreatic cancer patients and 34 mm in lung cancer patients. It is expected that effective motion tracking management will improve the accuracy of radiation delivery and allow the reduction of margin for the planning target volume (PTV); this will reduce the dose to the OARs and subsequently the radiation-induced complications.

传统的避免未击中运动目标的方法是，对GTV给一个更大的边缘余地，这可以确保对肿瘤的充分覆盖。但是，这不可避免的带来了对更大体积的照射，包含了周围的正常组织。之前的研究表明，肿瘤或器官运动在头脚方向最大，而左右或上下运动幅度相对更小。Akimoto等[9]表示，胰腺癌患者的肿瘤运动，在头脚方向会有15到24mm的运动幅度，肺癌患者有34mm的运动。有效的运动跟踪管理应当会改进放射治疗的准确率，使PTV的边缘余地可以降低；这会降低OAR受到的剂量，最终降低放射带来的并发症。

## 2. Motion management approaches

There are two main approaches in motion management: passive and active. The passive approach is the conventional method that does not involve any intervention on the patient during treatment. It works by chasing the entire path of tumor motion in the localization process using 4-dimensional (4D) CT. The taking of 4DCT helps to identify the trajectory of tumor movement at different phases of the respiratory cycle and define the internal target volume (ITV) and PTV, which can encompass all possible locations of the tumor during respiration. Compared with the active monitoring approach, the passive approach produces a relatively larger PTV margin. In addition, it also cannot correct for the potential difference in tumor motion between CT-simulation and actual treatment conditions, and therefore cannot directly address the intrafractional motion problem.

运动管理的主要方法可分为两类：被动的和主动的。被动的方法是传统的方法，在治疗中不对患者进行干涉，主要方法是使用4DCT，在定位过程中追踪肿瘤的运动的整个路径。4DCT的采用，帮助识别肿瘤运动在呼吸循环的不同时相的轨迹，定义了ITV和PTV，包含了呼吸过程中肿瘤的所有可能位置。与主动监控的方法比，被动方法会得到相对更大的PTV边缘余地。另外，它也不能修正肿瘤运动在CT模拟和实际治疗条件中的可能差异，因此不能直接处理分次内运动的问题。

The active approach can eliminate, reduce or track tumor motion during treatment. The methods developed include breath hold, forced shallow breathing with abdominal compression, respiratory gating and dynamic tumor tracking, which are discussed in the following paragraphs. A summary of the literatures which reported on the various active motion management methods are given in Table 1 and the details are discussed in the following paragraphs.

主动的方法可以消除、减少或跟踪治疗中的肿瘤运动。开发的方法包括屏气，腹压强迫浅呼吸，呼吸门控和动态肿瘤跟踪，下面的章节会进行讨论。表1给出了各种主动运动控制的方法的文献，细节在下列章节中讨论。

## 3. Intrafractional motion management

### 3.1. Breath hold

Clinically, breath hold method is used for radiotherapy of cancers in the thoracic and upper abdominal regions. It is important for treatment that requires higher precision such as the SBRT of lung and liver cancers. Meanwhile, voluntary deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) requires patient to voluntarily carry out a maximum inhalation and hold that level of inspiration during radiation delivery, either freely or with the help of a modified spirometer for 20 to 25 seconds. DIBH has been coupled with surface monitoring system, such as AlignRT (Vision RT Ltd, London, UK) or Real-time Position Management (RPM) (Fig. 1) (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) to allow an active monitoring of patient’s respiratory motion by using 3-dimensional surface tracking. AlignRT (Fig. 2) detects real-time surface image of patient, registers with the planned surface contour and calculates real-time positioning offsets, so that patient can be precisely aligned before treatment commence and monitored during treatment.

临床上，屏气方法用于胸部和上腹部癌症的放射治疗。这对于需要更高精度的治疗是重要的，比如肺癌和肝癌的SBRT。同时，主动的深吸气屏气(DIBH)需要病人主动的进行最大量的吸气，并在放射治疗时保持这个吸气的状态，可以自由吸气，或者在一个改装的肺活量计的帮助下，保持20-25秒。DIBH曾与表面监控系统共同使用，如AlignRT或RPM，以主动监控病人的呼吸运动，使用的是三维表面追踪。AlignRT检测患者的实时表面图像，与计划的表面边缘进行配准，计算实时的摆位偏差，这样在治疗开始之前患者可以精确的对齐，并在治疗时进行监控。

The RPM system uses an infrared camera mounted on the wall of the treatment room. Surrounding the camera, there are infrared lights aiming at the same direction as the camera. A marker box with reflective dots is usually placed at the xiphoid process or the upper abdomen of the patient to act as an external surrogate to measure the breathing motion of the patient. The camera detects the infrared lights reflected by the marker box and calculates its position. When the patient breathes, a graphical sinusoidal representation of the marker position is generated as a function of time, indicating the breathing motion of the patient. Breathing training is provided for the patient in order to obtain the deep inspiration threshold. Once the required threshold zone has been reached, the patient is asked to voluntarily hold the breath and the radiation is then given.

RPM系统使用一个装在治疗室墙上的红外相机。围绕着相机，有一些红外光与相机对着同样的方向。一个带有反射点的标记盒放在患者胸骨剑突处，或上腹部处，作为一个外部代理，测量患者的呼吸运动。相机检测标记盒反射的红外光，并计算其位置。当患者呼吸时，标记位置对时间的函数用一个正弦曲线表示，表明了患者的呼吸运动。要给患者进行呼吸训练，以获得深呼吸阈值。一旦达到要求的阈值地带，就要求患者主动屏气，然后进行放射治疗。

In the treatment of breast cancer, DIBH reduces cardiac dose by increasing the distance between the heart and the chest wall. This is particularly useful for the irradiation of the internal mammary nodes in the left side breast cancer patients where the target volume is closer to the heart [10, 11]. With DIBH technique, the heart is displaced posteriorly, medially and inferiorly away from the breast and the posterior border of the tangential fields; potentially avoiding radiation-associated cardiac perfusion [11]. It has been clinically proven that DIBH, with the use of AlignRT and RPM, was an effective mean to reduce cardiac injuries and cardiac mortality in radiotherapy of left breast cancer patients [12, 13].

在乳腺癌的治疗中，DIBH通过增加心脏和胸壁之间的距离，降低了心脏的剂量。这对于左侧乳腺癌患者的内部乳腺节点的放射治疗中尤其有用，其中目标体与心脏的距离很近。用DIBH技术，心脏与乳腺之间的关系可以是下侧，中间和上侧，切向野的下册边界；可能会避免放射治疗相关的心脏perfusion。临床上已经证明了，DIBH在使用AlignRT和RPM的情况下，是减少左侧乳腺癌患者心脏损伤和心脏死亡率的有效手段。

Furthermore, DIBH was also reported to reduce lung dose in which a reduction of at least 16% in lung mean dose and 20% in irradiated pulmonary volume were observed with the use of DIBH in left-sided breast treatment [14]. DIBH also benefits the treatment of right-sided breast cancer patients because it improves liver sparing compared to treatment under free breathing. Rice et al. reported that DIBH could displace the liver inferiorly and posteriorly away from the high dose, reducing the liver volume in the irradiated field by 63% and the mean liver dose by 46% [15]. However, there is one limitation about the system, which is the uncertainty about the accurate correlation of the external surrogate with the tumor position during the breathing process [16].

而且，DIBH还可以降低肺部的剂量，在左侧乳腺治疗中，使用DIBH可以降低肺部平均剂量16%，降低20%的肺部受照射体积。DIBH还会使右侧乳腺癌患者的治疗受益，因为与自由呼吸治疗相比，改善了保肝的情况。Rice等给出了DIBH可以将肝移到高剂量的上部和下部的结果，降低了肝部受照射的体积63%，平均肝部剂量降低46%。但是，系统有一个限制，即外部代理与肿瘤位置在呼吸过程中的关联的准确性，是不确定的。

Active Breathing Coordinator (ABC) (Fig. 3) (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden) is another commercially available system that helps the patient to withhold the breath so as to freeze the motion of the target volume during irradiation. The ABC system consists of a mouthpiece connected to a spirometer with pinch valves inside. A nose clip is applied to the patient to prevent breathing through the nose and the patient breathes solely through the mouthpiece. The spirometer is connected to a computer so that the inspiration level of the patient can be visualized. A switch is given to the patient for pressing when the patient is ready for breath-hold. Breathing training is provided for the patient before the actual treatment. Once the patient has reached the required threshold, the pinch valves in the spirometer close instantly to prevent the patient from breathing. During treatment, instruction to patient is achieved by broadcasting standardized audio command via intercom or with the aid of visual feedback tools.

主动呼吸调节(ABC, Active Breathing Coordinator)是另一种商用系统，帮助患者屏住呼吸，以在放射治疗的时候使目标的运动尽量停止。ABC系统包含一个含到咬嘴，与肺活量计连接到一起，里面有pinch valves。对患者使用鼻夹，以防止通过鼻子呼吸，所以患者只通过咬嘴进行呼吸。肺活量计与计算机连接到一起，这样患者的呼吸水平可以得到可视化。当患者准备好屏气后，患者就可以按一个开关。在实际治疗之前，对患者进行呼吸训练。一旦患者达到了需要的阈值，肺活量计中的pinch valves立刻关闭，以防止患者呼吸。在治疗中，对患者的指示，是通过广播标准化的语音命令进行的，通过内部通话系统，或在视觉反馈工具的帮助下。

After the required breath-hold time of about 20–25 seconds, the valves will open automatically to allow the patient to breathe normally through the mouthpiece again. The ABC system is interlocked with the linear accelerator so that the delivery of breath hold treatment can be automatic [17]. This method can be applied to the treatment of most thoracic cancers including lung cancer patients who may have difficulty to carry out breath hold by themselves. A feasibility study has reported that the duration and reproducibility of breath hold using ABC were possible in lung cancer patients without significant problems [18].

需要的屏气时间在20-25秒，在此之后，阀门会自动打开，以允许患者通过咬嘴再次正常呼吸。ABC系统与直线加速器是连锁的，这样屏气治疗可以自动进行。这种方法可以用于治疗大部分胸部癌症，包括肺癌患者，有的可能很难自己屏住呼吸。一份可行性研究表明，使用ABC的屏气的持续时间和可复现性，在肺癌患者中是可能的，没有明显的问题。

Furthermore, ABC was reported to effectively reduce target movement induced by respiratory motion and show major dosimetric improvement to OARs resulting in reduction of radiation-induced complications [19–22]. Wang et al. demonstrated significant dose reduction to the heart and the left anterior descending (LAD) artery using the ABC system, which could potentially reduce the cardiac risks[23]. In addition, ABC system was also reported to provide good intrafractional and interfractional reproducibility of the chest wall and tracheal bifurcation [24] and facilitate potential reduction of margin to target volume and dose escalation compared with free-breathing [25].

而且，据报道ABC可以有效的降低由于呼吸运动引起的目标运动，对OARs有明显的剂量改进，结果是降低了放射引起的并发症。Wang等证明了，使用ABC系统，对心脏和LAD动脉有显著的剂量降低，这很可能降低心脏的风险。另外，ABC系统还报道说，可以得到很好的分次内和分次间的胸壁和气管bifurcation的可复现性，与自由呼吸相比，促进目标体的边缘余地和剂量上涨可能的降低。

According to Lu et al. [26], substantial intrafractional motions of more than 3 mm were observed in 26.3% of liver cancer patients and in 46.7% of lung cancer patients. Breath hold technique can eliminate such motions and effectively reduce the treatment planning margins. Because of this, it is more commonly used for SBRT of lung and liver cancer cases in which a relatively small PTV can be achieved.

根据Lu等[26]，在26.3%的肝癌患者和46.7%的肺癌患者中，发现了超过3mm的显著的分次内运动。屏气技术可以消除这种运动，并有效的降低治疗计划边缘余地。由此，肺部和肝脏的SBRT更经常使用，其中可以得到相对更小的PTV。

Despite there are potential dosimetric benefits in breath-hold techniques, their clinical implementation is not without difficulty. DIBH and ABC are not totally patient-friendly; and they require training of patients for the specified breathing pattern. It is mainly suitable for patients with satisfactory respiratory function. The setup procedures of the whole system are complex and time-consuming. Patients of older age or poorer general condition may not show good compliance to the procedure. As a result, workload of the therapists and the treatment setup and delivery time will be increased. Because of this, proper patient selection is a pre-requisite in the success of the treatment.

尽管屏气技术有潜在的剂量优势，其临床应用并非没有困难。DIBH和ABC并不是完全对患者友好的；它们需要训练患者，以得到指定的呼吸模式，这主要适用于有很好的呼吸功能的患者。整个系统的设置过程是很复杂的，也很耗时。年纪更大的患者，或状况更差的患者，可能不一定很好的接受这个过程。结果是，治疗人员的工作量，治疗设置和治疗时间都增加了。因此，要成功的进行治疗，必须预先选择合适的患者。

### 3.2. Abdominal compression

Abdominal compression is achieved through the application of abdominal compression belt or custom abdominal corset by applying pressure to patient’s abdomen so as to limit diaphragm excursion [7]. The system forces the patient to maintain shallow breathing and limits the magnitude of diaphragmatic motion in the supero-inferior direction. This will reduce the associated tumor motion and subsequently the size of ITV [27]. Commercial products including the Anzai Belt (Anzai Medical, Shinagawa, Japan), BodyFIX (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden) and Neofrakt corset (Spronken Orthopedics, Genk, Belgium) (Fig. 4) are available. Clinically, these products are used in SBRT of abdominal region such as pancreatic and liver cancers. Abdominal compression belt has the advantages of simple implementation with minimal technological requirement and allows continuous irradiation [28].

腹压是通过腹压带或定制的腹部紧身衣实现的，这样可以对患者的腹部施加压力，以限制膈膜运动。系统迫使患者保持很浅的呼吸，限制膈膜运动在上下方向的幅度。这会减少相关的肿瘤运动，然后降低ITV的大小。商用产品包括Anzai Belt，BodyFix和Neofrakt紧身衣。临床上，这些产品用于腹部区域的SBRT，如胰腺癌和肝癌。腹压带有实现简单的优点，需要的技术含量不高，可以进行持续的照射。

The benefits of abdominal compression have been reported in several studies. Llacer-Moscardo et al. revealed that the discrepancy in liver position due to intrafractional motion was significantly reduced by using compression belt in liver SBRT [29] and Heerkens et al. stated that tumor motion in cranio-caudal direction was reduced by almost 40% with the use of custom abdominal corset in radiotherapy of pancreatic cancer patients [7]. However, there are limitations in abdominal compression devices that make it still less widely used. For instance, the compression belt is uncomfortable and challenging for patients with poor lung function, claustrophobia or obesity problems. Furthermore, it may cause unpredictable and irregular breathing pattern and lead to unsatisfactory results [22]. The ability of compression belt to reduce target motion also varies among patients and depends greatly on the site of treatment [30].

腹压的好处有几个研究进行了报道。Llacer-Moscardo等表示，在肝部SBRT中使用腹压，可以显著降低分次内运动导致的肝部位置差异；Heerkens等表明，在胰腺癌患者的放射治疗中，用定制的腹部紧身衣，可以降低40%的头脚方向的肿瘤运动。但是，在腹压设备中有一些限制，使其现在仍然使用没那么广泛。比如，压带不舒服，对于肺部功能不好、幽闭恐惧症或肥胖问题的的患者是一个挑战。而且，其可能导致不可预测的和不规则的呼吸模式，导致不满意的结果。压带减少目标运动的能力对不同患者是不同的，极大的依赖于治疗的部位。

### 3.3. Respiratory gating

Respiratory gating exploits the periodic nature of breathing cycle and delivers radiation only at designated period of individual cycle. With real-time monitoring, gating can be performed with patient breathing freely or constrained when combined with other motion management strategies. Radiation beam is only activated at specific phases of breathing cycle when the target moves in the distinctively predefined window. Position and width of the gating window depend prominently on individual tumor motion behavior, and are determined by observing patient’s respiratory motion using either external surrogate or internal fiducial markers [31].

呼吸门控利用了呼吸循环的周期性本质，只在单个循环的指定时间段进行放射治疗。在实时监控的情况下，门控可以在患者自由呼吸时进行，也可以在与其他运动管理策略结合使用时约束使用。放射束流只在呼吸循环的特定相位激活，这是目标在特别预定义的窗口中运动。门控窗的位置和宽度主要依赖于个体的肿瘤运动行为，是通过使用外部代理或内部fiducial标记来观察患者的呼吸运动确定的。

Gating window is usually selected with minimal estimated tumor motion and maximal lung volume, which are the exhale and inhale phases of a breathing cycle respectively. Time spent by the signal within the gate to overall treatment time is used as a measure for the efficiency of the system and referred as duty cycle. At gated treatment, patient’s breathing motion is monitored throughout the treatment session with internal fiducial markers to indicate tumor position, or external surrogates to indicate respiration signals, or patient’s breathing pattern by optical imaging of patient’s surface anatomy [22] (Fig. 5).

门控窗通常用肿瘤运动的最小估计和最大肺体积选择的，这分别是一个呼吸循环的呼气和吸气阶段。在门内信号的时间与总计治疗时间的比，用作系统效率的度量，称为一个duty cycle。在门控治疗中，患者的呼吸运动是在整个治疗过程中都进行监控的，使用内部fiducial标记来指示肿瘤运动，或外部代理来指示呼吸信号，或使用患者表面解剖结构的光学成像来指示患者的呼吸模式。

Currently, two major approaches are being employed for gated treatment in clinical practice. One approach is using external surrogate, such as patient putting on a jacket or vest with reflective markers (Fig. 6) or holding a box with reflective markers in-place on patient skin using elastic belt. Potential tumor motion is represented by external surrogate, monitored through imaging detection system with a frequency depending on the system used. Motion of the external surrogate is presumed to be closely correlated with the internal tumor motion. The other approach is implanting fiducial markers such as gold fiducials or ceramic markers close to the tumor by surgical method.

目前，在临床实践中主要采用两种方法进行门控治疗。一种方法是使用外部代理，比如患者穿上一件外衣，带有反射性的标记，或使用弹性带在患者皮肤表面固定一个带有反射性标记的盒子。可能的肿瘤运动通过外部代理进行表示，通过成像检测系统进行监测，频率依赖于使用的系统。外部代理的运动假设与内部肿瘤的运动是紧密相关的。其他的方法还有，植入内部fiducial标记，如通过手术的方法在接近肿瘤处植入金标或瓷标。

Gated treatment usually lengthens the overall treatment time because the radiation is delivered in an intermittent manner. In addition, the outcome of gated treatment is patient dependent; patients with comparatively stable breathing and considerably larger intrafraction tumor motion will benefit most from gating since a significant reduction of PTV and normal tissue irradiation can be specified [27].

门控治疗通常延长了总体治疗时间，因为放射治疗是间歇式进行的。另外，门控治疗的输出是依赖于患者的；呼吸比较稳定的患者，和分次内肿瘤运动较大的患者，会从门控中获益较大，因为PTV会显著降低，正常组织的放射可以指定。

The external surrogates for respiratory chest motion can be provided from commercial available systems including the RPM (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA), and the AlignRT (VisionRT, London, UK) which uses 3-dimenional surface imaging approach. As mentioned before, the RPM system uses a marker box placed on the surface of the chest wall, which is relatively simple and convenient to use. Cautious has to be taken not to impede the motion by treatment accessories or patient’s clothing. One important assumption of this gating method is that the internal target motion is precisely correlated to the external surrogate, and the correlation remains unchanged intrafractionally. Based on this assumption, tumor motion can be truly represented by external surrogates and predicted by using the external respiratory signal [32].

呼吸胸部运动的外部代理，目前有可用的商用系统，包括RPM，AlignRT，后者使用的是三维表面成像技术。就像前面提到的，RPM系统使用的标记盒放在胸壁表面，使用起来相对简单方便。需要注意的是，不要让治疗附件或患者的衣服阻碍运动。这种门控方法的一个重要的假设是，内部目标运动与外部代理是精确关联的，而且在分次间治疗中，这种关联保持不变。基于这种假设，肿瘤运动可以由外部代理真实的代表，可以用外部呼吸信号进行预测。

Internal markers approach allows real time visualization of target and surrounding tissue and the tumor position can be monitored directly by fluoroscopic imaging [22]. Several studies reported that the use of internal markers gave better tumor-surrogate correlation than the external surrogate method[33, 34]. However, there are some limitations in this method. For instance, patient has to undergo an operation, which is relatively invasive. In addition, there are fixation issues and migration problems of fiducial markers in the tissues. Detachment or dislocation of fiducial markers over time is not unusual and this may lead to possible change of geometric relationship between the markers and tumor [35]. In order to minimize this problem, there have been suggestions to perform continuous monitoring of the marker-tumor relationship during treatment [30]. In addition, the use of computer-optimized gating parameters could further improve the gating accuracy and reduce the PTV margin [32].

内部标记方法，可以对目标和周围组织的运动进行实时的可视化，肿瘤位置可以通过透视成像直接进行监控。几个研究工作表明，使用内部标记，比外部代理，可以得到更好的肿瘤代理关联。但是，这种方法有一些限制。比如，患者必须进行手术，这是入侵性的。此外，还有固定的问题，和fiducial标记在组织中的转移问题。Fiducial标记随着时间的脱离或错位是经常的，这可能会导致标记和肿瘤的相对几何关系的改变。为使这个问题最小化，有建议对标记-肿瘤关系在治疗中进行持续的监控。此外，使用计算机优化的门控参数可以进一步改进门控的准确率，降低PTV边缘余地。

Another consideration in gated treatment is the residual tumor motion, which refers to the tumor motion occurred within the “gated window”. Substantial fluctuations of magnitude of more than 300% have been observed in residual tumor motion within the same fraction of treatment [36]. Although respiratory gating reduced the total tumor motion, residual tumor motion was found to be arbitrary and unpredictable. Because of this, caution should be taken so as to choose an optimal gate width for individual patients.

门控治疗的另一种考虑是残余肿瘤运动，这是指在门控窗口内的肿瘤运动。在同一分次治疗中，残余肿瘤运动曾经观察到大于300%的幅度波动。虽然呼吸门控降低了总共的肿瘤运动，残余肿瘤运动是任意的、不可预测的。因此，需要注意这个，并对个体患者选择最优的门控宽度。

### 3.4. Motion tracking

An ideal intrafractional motion tracking system should be able to accurately and efficiently locate the moving tumor/target during treatment and feeds back to the system to make appropriate adjustment of the radiation beam. It can be classified in to tumor tracking, multi-leaf collimator (MLC) tracking and couch tracking.

一种理想的分次内运动追踪系统，应当可以在治疗中，准确高效的定位运动肿瘤/目标，并反馈给系统，对射束进行合适的调整。这可以分类为肿瘤追踪，MLC追踪和床追踪三种。

### 3.5. Tumor tracking

Tumor tracking refers to the continuous detection of the changing position of tumor, target or its correlated surrogates. Many clinical systems are equipped with real-time x-ray to perform dynamic tumor localization. They include CyberKnife (Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA), Vero® system (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Tokyo, Japan and Brainlab, Feldkirchen, Germany) and ExacTrac® (Brainlab, Feldkirchen, Germany).

肿瘤追踪指的是肿瘤、目标或其关联的代理的变化位置的连续检测。很多临床系统都装备了实时X射线，进行动态肿瘤定位。这包括CyberKnife，Vero和ExacTrac。

CyberKnife consists of a compact linear accelerator mounted on a robotic arm which enables movements in all directions, and a 6 degree of freedom (DoF) treatment couch (RoboCouch). Imaging system of the CyberKnife consists of two diagnostic x-ray sources and two amorphous silicon detector cameras that image patient at 45◦ orthogonal angles. The imaging system generates real-time images during treatment and compared against the digital reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) generated from the planning CT. At the same time, the RoboCouch adjusts its position accordingly to the signals generated from the imaging matching result [37]. The system can continuously track intrafraction tumor motion at different anatomical sites with the use of external or internal surrogates. During treatment, the actual tumor trajectories are reflected by the motion signals from the surrogates, measured and fed to a correlation function which then estimates the true tumor position [31].

CyberKnife是一套安装的机械臂上的紧凑的直线加速器，可以在各个方向进行运动，还有一个6自由度的治疗床(RoboCouch)。CyberKnife的成像系统包含两个诊断x射线源和2个非晶硅探测器，在45度的正交方向对患者进行成像。成像系统在治疗中生成实时的图像，与DRR进行比较。同时，RoboCouch根据图像匹配结果相应的调整其位置。系统可以持续的追踪不同解剖位置的分次内肿瘤运动，使用外部代理或内部代理。在治疗中，实际的肿瘤轨迹通过代理的运动信号反应，测量并送入到一个关联函数，估计真实的肿瘤位置。

The Vero® system integrates imaging and positioning capabilities in a treatment system. It performs treatment with dual-diagnostic x-ray for simultaneous stereo imaging and 6DoF patient positioning during treatment. In addition, with the built-in stereo fluoroscopic facility, it allows real-time imaging of moving targets. The Vero® system is mainly used for treatment of thoracic and pelvic cancers using the hypofractionation schemes [26]. An evaluation performed by Burghelea et al. reported that the Vero® system was capable of following complex gantry ring trajectories using the orthogonal x-ray fluoroscopic imaging with maximum deviation below 0.6° during dynamic wave arc delivery [38]. Another study by Depuydt et al. revealed that PTV volume reduction was achieved with the use of real-time tumor tracking solution in Vero® treatment for respiratory correlated SBRT [39].

Vero系统在治疗系统中集成了成像和摆位能力。其在治疗时，采用双诊断x射线进行同时立体成像，并进行6自由度患者摆位。此外，有了内建的立体透视成像能力，可以进行运动目标的实时成像。Vero系统主要用于治疗胸部和盆部肿瘤，使用大剂量分割的方案。Burghelea等进行的评估表明，Vero系统可以进行下面的复杂机架环形轨迹，使用正交的x射线透视成像能力，在进行动态波弧形治疗时，最大偏差低于0.6度。Depuydt等进行的另一个研究表明，通过使用Vero的实时肿瘤跟踪，进行呼吸关联的SBRT，PTV体得到了降低。

ExacTrac® (Fig. 7) is an x-ray based patient position monitoring system incorporated to a linear accelerator that detects intrafractional tumor motion. It consists of two kV x-ray units mounted with the beams passing through the center of treatment region at 45° from one another. Images can be taken and reviewed during radiation treatment and automatic matching is performed using the built-in verification programme. This instantaneous x-ray imaging with 6D fusion provides positioning information and reduces the possibility of geographical miss of the target due to patient motion or internal anatomy shift. Any deviations in tumor position can be corrected automatically and instantaneously via the robotic 6DoF treatment couch system. ExactTrac® has been reported to be useful for evaluating setup uncertainties and determining setup margin [40]. Oh et al. reported that in the treatment of intracranial SRS, the setup discrepancy in residual setup errors between ExacTrac® and cone beam was very mild [41]. Compared with on-board imaging, ExacTrac® could reduce the verification time and organ dose, and it was relatively more effective in the pelvic region when compared with the head and neck region[42].

ExacTrac是一种基于x射线的患者摆位监控系统，集成到线性加速器中，检测分次间肿瘤运动。系统由两个KV x射线单元组成，其射线穿过治疗中心区域交叉45度。可以在放射治疗过程中进行成像，并使用内建的验证程序进行匹配。这种x射线的立刻成像和6D融合，提供了摆位信息，降低了由于患者运动或内部解剖结构偏移导致的目标丢失的可能性。肿瘤位置的任何偏移，都可以通过机械6自由度治疗床系统，得到自动的立刻修正。ExactTrac对于评估设置不确定性和确定设置边缘余量是有用的。Oh等表示，在颅内SRS的治疗中，ExacTrac和c锥形束的残余设置误差的设置差异不大。与OBI相比，ExacTrac可以降低验证时间和器官剂量，与头颈部相比，在盆部相对更加有效。

### 3.6. MLC tracking

MLC tracking involves the use of real-time imaging, respiratory modelling and predictive algorithms to anticipate motion patterns and correlate dose delivery in linear accelerator (e.g. TrueBeam, Varian Medical System, Palo Alto, CA). The goal of MLC tracking is to reposition radiation beam dynamically to follow tumor motion during irradiation, to correct for tumor position discrepancy resulted from intrafraction motion. To accomplish this, the system must be able to detect tumor position in real-time, compensate for the time delay in beam-positioning response and reposition the beam. When tumor position signal is received and processed, the MLC aperture will be reconfigured in near real-time to compensate the detected or predicted motion by a specific algorithm. Instead of adding an internal margin to the clinical target volume to create an ITV, MLC are used to follow the target and consequently allow better sparing of adjacent normal tissues [43, 44]. The impact of MLC tracking depends on the magnitude of tumor motion; patients with larger tumor motion will be benefit from larger reductions in target volume and subsequent reductions in OARs doses.

MLC追踪涉及到使用实时成像、呼吸建模和预测算法，来预料运动模式，并与直线加速器中的剂量输送关联起来。MLC追踪的目的是，在放射治疗期间，动态的调整射束的位置，以跟踪肿瘤运动，修正分次内运动导致的肿瘤位置差异。为完成这个任务，系统必须能够实时检测到肿瘤位置，补偿射束响应位置调整的时间延迟，并调整射束位置。当接收到肿瘤位置信号并进行处理，MLC以接近实时的效率进行重新配置，以补偿由特定算法检测到的或预测到的运动。不需要对临床目标体增加一个内部边缘余量，来生成ITV，MLC用于跟踪目标，并使临近正常组织的sparing更好。MLC追踪的影响，依赖于肿瘤运动的幅度；肿瘤运动较大的患者，目标体的降低会更大，OARs剂量也会降低，因此受益更多。

Previous studies reported that both PTV size and dose to normal tissue could be reduced using MLC tracking when compared with ITV-based planning in SBRT of lung cancer patients [43, 45, 46]. To enhance MLC tracking efficacy, Murtaza et al. suggested the use of rotating collimator instead of fixed collimator VMAT treatment [47]. In addition, the application of MLC tracking in VMAT can be effectively accomplished without the requirement of an internal target margin provided the system latency is less than 150 ms [43].

之前的研究表明，在肺癌患者SBRT中使用MLC跟踪，与基于ITV的计划相比，PTV大小和正常组织的剂量都有所降低。为增强MLC追踪的效率，Murtaza等建议使用旋转的准直器，而不要使用固定准直器的VMAT治疗。另外，如果系统的延迟低于150ms，VMAT中MLC跟踪的应用，可以有效的完成，而不需要内部目标边缘余量。

A challenge to dynamic MLC tracking is time delay compensation. Treatment system latencies including image acquisition, image processing, communication delay and control system processing have been reported [32]. To compensate the time delay predicament, use of predictive algorithms was suggested. By applying breathing predictions models with a range of adaptive filters, tumor position can be predicted with up to 80% accuracy in the presence of a 200 ms system time delay [48].

动态MLC追踪的一个挑战，是时间延迟补偿。治疗系统延迟包括，图像获取，图像处理，通信延迟和控制系统处理的延迟。为补偿延时，建议使用预测算法。通过使用带有很多自适应滤波器的呼吸预测模型，在200ms系统延迟的情况下，肿瘤位置可以有80%的预测准确率。

### 3.7. Couch tracking

Couch tracking compensates tumor motion by adjusting the couch position via a 6DoF robotic system (e.g. PerfectPitch 6DoF, Varian Medical System, Palo Alto, CA) which is based on the continuous tracking of tumor motion by real-time image guidance system and computer algorithm to calculate the necessary couch movement [31]. In clinical practice, couch tracking is integrated with tumor-localization signal feedback system, such as electromagnetic beacon transponder in CalypsoTM (Varian Medical System, Palo Alto, CA) to re-align the treatment couch position in response to tumor motion[6]. The CalypsoTM system mainly applies to treatment of prostate cancer in which three tiny Beacon® transponders are inserted in the prostate gland and communicate with the CalypsoTM system through a detection plate using radiofrequency waves during treatment.

床的跟踪，通过使用6自由度机器人系统来调整床的位置，来补偿肿瘤的运动，这是基于肿瘤运动的连续跟踪，通过实时图像引导系统和计算机算法来计算必要的床的运动。在临床实践中，床的跟踪是与肿瘤定位信号反馈系统整合到一起的，比如电磁信标转发器，以重新对齐治疗床的位置，响应肿瘤的运动。Calypso系统主要应用在前列腺癌的治疗中，三个微小的金标转发器插入到前列腺中，并与Calypso系统通过一个检测板在治疗中使用无线电波进行通信。

Couch tracking can be performed in either single direction or concurrently in all 6DoF along the x, y, z, pitch, roll and yaw directions. Commercially available robotic couch systems include the HexaPOD Couch (Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden), the PerfectPitch Couch (Varian Medical System, Palo Alto, CA) and the RoboCouch (Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA). All of them are equipped with robotic alignment couch with 6DoF. Sub-millimeter accuracy in motion correction has been reported when couch tracking was integrated with kilovoltage intrafaction monitoring system in SBRT of prostate cancer [49, 50].

床的跟踪可以可以在一个方向进行，或同时在所有6DoF中进行，即x, y, z, pitch, roll and yaw方向。可以商用的机器人床系统，包含HexaPOD床，PerfectPitch床和RoboCouch。这几种都装备了6DoF的机器人对齐床。当床跟踪与KV分次内监控系统整合到一起，在前列腺肿瘤的SBRT中，可以达到运动修正的亚毫米的准确率。

Compared with breath hold and gating, dynamic tumor tracking allows tracking of tumor motion close to real-time, reduces patient discomfort and patient participation such as breath-holding, and allows continuous treatment [27]. Because of these, it offers a relatively shorter treatment time.

与屏气和门控相比，动态肿瘤跟踪可以接近实时的跟踪肿瘤运动，降低患者的不适感和减少屏气的行为，可以进行持续的治疗。因此，可以得到相对更短的治疗时间。

### 3.8. MRI-guided treatment

MRI provides enhanced soft-tissue contrast compared to CT for target and organ delineation, and better organ and tumor visualization. This saves the use of internal markers as surrogates during the tracking process, and therefore eliminates the possibility of inconsistent correlation between the surrogates and the tumor motion. With the recent release of MRI-linear accelerators (i.e. Unity, Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden) that equip with the cine acquisition techniques, such as the Balanced Steady-State Free Precession (BSSFP) sequences, it is able to generate movie-like images to reveal intrafractional motion during the delivery of radiation [51]. The cine mode of MRI is able to directly detect real-time motion and deformation of tumor and OARs due to breathing, bowel movement, bowel gas, rectal and bladder filling. All of them can be visualized during the delivery of radiotherapy [51–53]. This implies that MRI guided radiotherapy provides effective tumor tracking environment and is superior in detecting soft tissue tumors. Sagittal MR images can be generated at a rate of 4fps, i.e. 4 images per second. This feature is superior to other real-time imaging systems, which can only take periodic x-ray images for positional verification. Furthermore, MRI-linear accelerator can also support gated treatment in which the moving soft tissue tumor can be viewed directly without the need of fiducial markers. Radiation will be switched on when the tumor moves into the pre-defined boundary decided by the oncologist. Crijns et al. studied on the gating application of MRI-linear accelerator and reported that real-time on-line reconstruction of the accumulated dose could be performed using time-resolved position information, which facilitated intrafactional plan adaptation [54].

与CT相比，MRI可以得到增强的软组织对比度，进行更好的目标和组织勾画，得到组织和肿瘤的更好的可视化。这就不需要在追踪的过程中使用内部标记作为代理，因此消除了代理和肿瘤运动的不一致关联的可能性。随着最近MRI直线加速器的发布，装备了cine获取技术，比如BSSFP序列，就可以生成像电影一样的图像，在放射治疗期间看到分次内的运动。MRI的cine模式可以直接检测肿瘤和OAR的实时运动和形变，呼吸、肠管的蠕动，肠管的气体，直肠和膀胱的充盈。所有这些都可以在放射治疗期间可视化看到。这意味着MRI引导的放射治疗提供的有效的肿瘤跟踪环境，在检测软组织肿瘤性能优越。生成的sagittal MR图像可以达到4fps。这个特征是远超于其他的实时成像系统的，比如周期性的获取x射线图像进行位置验证。而且，MRI直线加速器还可以支持门控治疗，其中运动的软组织肿瘤可以直接看到，不需要内部fiducial标记。当肿瘤移动到预定义的边缘时（由肿瘤学家确定），就打开放射开关。Crijns等研究了MRI直线加速器的门控应用，表示实时在线重建累积的剂量，可以使用时间分辨的位置信息进行，这促进了分次内计划的调整。

Apart from the superiority of MRI over x-ray in tracking soft tissue tumors, it does not deliver extra radiation dose to patient as in the cases of x-ray imaging or cone beam CT. Other potential advantages of MR-guided treatment include provision of daily online adaptive treatment plan optimization and reduction of treatment margins [55]. It is expected that with the advantages over other imaging modalities and the progressive maturity of the associated technology, MRI would be the most effective modalities for tumor motion management in future.

MRI比X射线在追踪软组织肿瘤中有优越性，除此以外，MRI还不会对患者造成额外的放射剂量，这在x射线或cbct成像中都有。MRI引导的治疗的其他可能的优势，包括可以进行每日在线自适应治疗计划优化，降低治疗边缘余量。有相对于其他成像模态的优势，相关技术也会逐渐成熟，MRI可能未来会成为最高效的肿瘤运动管理的模态。

## 4. Conclusions

Managing of moving target has been a challenge in external beam radiotherapy. Various solutions including the breath hold and tumor tracking approaches coupled with the development of sophisticated devices have been recently introduced to solve this problem. The use of breath hold approach is useful for irradiation of tumors in the chest and abdominal regions. However, its effectiveness depends on the condition and participation of the patients. Tumor tracking requires the support of imaging tools and sophisticated algorithms that are integrated with the treatment machine. Currently, x-ray is the most commonly used imaging modality, however, it is expected that MRI, with its superiority in image quality and real-time soft tissue imaging, may overtake x-ray and become the most effective modality in future. With the introduction of MRI-linear accelerator, on-line adaptation and respiratory modelling, current motion management strategies can further be enhanced, treatment margins can be reduced and radiation-associated toxicity can be minimized.

运动目标管理一直是外照射放射治疗的挑战。各种解决方案，包括屏气，肿瘤追踪，与各种复杂设备的开发一起，都用于解决这个问题。屏气方法的使用，对于胸腹部的肿瘤放射是有用的。但是，其有效性依赖于患者的自身条件和参与。肿瘤追踪需要成像设备和复杂算法的支持，与治疗机器整合到一起。目前，X射线是最常见的成像模态，但是，MRI的成像质量更好，实时软组织成像能力也更强，可能取代x射线，成为最高效的模态。随着MRI直线加速器的引入，在线调整和呼吸建模，目前的呼吸运动管理策略未来可以进一步得到加强，治疗边缘余量能够得到降低，放射治疗相关的副作用可以得到最小化。
